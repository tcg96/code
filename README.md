# code
Some of my programming shit. I use Java because that's what I was taught (and am still being) at university. Note: My programming skills suck. All programs here are ridiculously stupid; some on purpose.

If you don’t know Java, you need the JDK (Java SE Development Kit) to compile and run these programs (files ending in `.java` are source code). To install it:
* On Mac, just type `javac` in the Terminal, which will prompt you to install it.
* On Linux, type `sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk` in the Terminal. If this doesn’t work, you know another way to install it.
* On Windows, google “jdk” to download the installer. You’ll also have to set the proper environment variables, google is still your friend. 

To compile Java source code files, navigate to the folder they are in using your command prompt/terminal, then type: `javac filename.java` (replace filename with the real file name). This will create one or more .class files.
To run them, note the name of the class that contains the `public static void main` method, and run: `java ClassName` (**without** `.class` at the end, replacing ClassName with the real class name).

### TM3.java
I’m writing this at 12:54 pm. 1+2+5+4 = 12, which is a multiple of 3. What are all the other times which are multiples of 3?

### The.java
Combination of these two dank-ass memes:

### echo.java
Because the `echo` command built into any shell isn’t good enough.
